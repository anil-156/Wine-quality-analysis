# üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis ‚Äì Power BI Project

## üìä Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Wine Quality** using **Power BI** and statistical metrics derived from a wine quality dataset. The goal is to understand how various physicochemical attributes (e.g., acidity, alcohol, pH) influence wine quality ratings and to uncover actionable insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## üîç Objectives

- Explore correlations between wine properties and quality score.
- Visualize key distributions and trends in wine characteristics.
- Enable data-driven decisions for wine production optimization.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** for dashboard design and interactivity  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated columns and measures  
- **Excel/CSV** as the raw data source

## üß† Key Features

1. **Dashboard Pages**:
   - **Overview**: Displays quality distribution, alcohol vs quality correlation, etc.
   - **Chemical Composition Analysis**: Explores the role of pH, sulphates, citric acid, and more.
   - **Influence Metrics**: Identifies key attributes influencing wine quality.
   - **Conclusion/Takeaways**: Summarizes insights for winemakers and analysts.

2. **DAX Measures**:
   - Average alcohol per quality group  
   - Quality-wise chemical composition averages  
   - Percent share of each quality level  
   - Conditional formatting for standout metrics

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, pie charts, and heatmaps
   - Filters for interactive drilling (e.g., quality level, alcohol range)

## üìà Key Insights

- **Alcohol content** showed strong positive correlation with wine quality.  
- **Volatile acidity** and **density** negatively impacted the quality ratings.  
- Wines with balanced **pH**, higher **citric acid**, and moderate **sulphates** scored better.  
- Most wines fall under the quality score range of **5 to 7** (on a scale of 0‚Äì10).
